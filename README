Erlycombinator - Y Combinator implementation in erlang


This is a incomplete step-by-step implementation of the Y Combinator - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_combinator - function in erlang using test-driven development.

Basically, following the same reasoning from the book "the little schemer", pages 160-173.

Only the deduction part (aka "hard part") is implemented here - the final refactoring to extract the y-combinator function is not yet in place. For now, please check the python version at http://github.com/bzanchet/pycombinator.

It's tested according to Joe Armstrong suggestion called "micro lightweight unit testing" - more info at http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/2009/01/micro-lightweight-unit-testing.html.


To run the "micro lightweight" test suite:
$ make test

To clean intermediate files:
$ make clean
